# NNIP QA Exercise

This exercise is to examine your technical knowledge, and testing skill; there are no tricks or hidden agendas. We are looking for a demonstration of your experience and skillset using your current testing technologies and methodologies.

Make sure that your code is clear, demonstrates good practices, and that you include a readme file explaining how to build and run your solution - please don't spend more than 2 to 4 hours on this.

Don't worry if you're stuck or aren't able to get it up and running, as long as you can explain to us what steps you took (or will take) to approach the given exercise. For the automated testing you can use the language of your choice, and the framework of your choice. As long as the exercise comes back with the required steps for running the test.

## Exercise

Test case: 
Dutch non professional clients ("particuliere belegger") should be able to reach our retail client website Fitvermogen.nl through our main website nnip.com.

Write a test that navigates to our main website NNIP.com landing page and from there navigate through the audiences selection to the dutch FitVermogen page.

## Optional
Test case:
International clients should be able to find detailed information for their favorite fund LU0362138090 by searching the identifier.

Write a test where starting from nnip.com, you will navigate to the international professional section and end up openening the detail page for this provided fund code.

## Checklist
Please ensure you have submitted back to us the following:

- A pubic repository (e.g. GitHub, BitBucket) containing the requirements and automated tests
- A readme explaining: How to build and execute your solution

Good luck and thank you for your time - we look forward to see your solution.

Keep in mind that your solution will form the basis in the follow-up conversation that we've planned with you.
