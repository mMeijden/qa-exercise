# qa-exercise

This exercise is to examine your technical knowledge, and testing skill; there are no tricks or hidden agendas. We are looking for a demonstration of your experience and skill using current testing technologies and methodologies.

Make sure that your code is clear, demonstrates good practices, and that you include a readme file explaining how to build and run your solution - please don't spend more than 2 to 4 hours on this. 


Bear in mind that your solution will form the basis for a follow-up conversation.

##Checklist
Please ensure you have submitted the following:

A pubic repository (e.g. GitHub, BitBucket) containing the requirements and automated tests
A readme explaining
How to build and execute your solution
Details on anything further that you would like to achieve given more time, including any trade-offs that you may have made
Good luck and thank you for your time - we look forward to seeing your creation.

Don't worry if you're stuck or aren't able to get it up and running for us, as long as you can explain to us what steps you took to approach the given exercises.
